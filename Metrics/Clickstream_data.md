# Clickstream Data - Cheatsheet 

## Introduction-What-is-Cliick Stream Data ?

> Clickstream data is the trail of clicks a user makes while navigating a website or application. It records every action, such as what pages were viewed, in what order, and how long the user spent on each page. This datacan include information like the user's IP address, browser type, operating system, and referring URL.
> It's called "clickstream" because it's a continuous stream of user activity, like a stream of water, where each click is a point in that flow.
> Analysts use clickstream data to understand user behavior, optimize website design, personalize content, and improve overall user experience. For example, it can reveal popular pages, common navigation paths, points where users abandon a process, or even identify potential issues with a site's usability.

## 1. Navigation and Path Analysis KPIs

> These key performance indicators measure how users move through a website or application, including the pages they visit, the order of their visits, and the duration of their sessions, to understand their flow and popular routes.

|Command | description|
|---------------------|-------------|
|`Pages Viewed Per Session`|	The average number of unique pages a user visits during a single session.|
|`Average Session Duration`|	The average amount of time a user spends on the site or application during one session.|
|`Bounce Rate`|	The percentage of single-page sessions where the user leaves the site from the entrance page without interacting with the page..|

|`Popular Pages/Content`| Which pages or content areas receive the most views.|
|`Average Page Depth`| The average number of pages a user views in a session before leaving. (Similar to "Pages Viewed Per Session" but emphasizes the depth of engagement within a specific path.)|
|`Session Start and End Points`| Which pages users typically start their sessions on, and where they typically leave the site.|
|`Next Page Path`| The most common page a user visits immediately after a specific page.|


## 2. Engagement KPIs

> These metrics quantify how users interact with content and features on a site beyond just page views, such as scrolling depth, video plays, and specific button clicks, to gauge user involvement.

|Command | description|
|---------------------|-------------|
|`Scroll Depth`| How far down a page users scroll.|
|`Event Tracking (e.g., Video Plays, Downloads, Button Clicks)`|Specific interactions users perform beyond just page views.|
|`Time on Page`| The average amount of time a user spends viewing a specific page.|
|`Conversion Rate`| The percentage of users who complete a desired action (e.g., purchase, sign-up, form submission).|
|`Interaction Rate/Click-Through Rate (CTR) on Internal Elements`| For specific components or calls-to-action within a page (e.g., how many users click a "Read More" button on a blog post).|
|`Form Field Interactions/Drop-offs`| For forms, tracking which fields are interacted with and where users abandon the form.|
|`Mouse Movement/Heatmaps`| While not a "click" per se, these can be derived from clickstream-like data to show areas of interest or confusion (requires specialized tools).|
|`Content Popularity by Format`| Differentiating popularity based on content type (e.g., articles vs. videos vs. interactive tools).|


## 3. User Acquisition & Retention KPIs

> These indicators focus on where users come from and how often they return, distinguishing between new and returning visitors and identifying referral sources to assess audience growth and loyalty.

|Command | description|
|---------------------|-------------|
|`Referral Sources`| Where users are coming from (e.g., organic search, social media, direct, referral links).|
|`New vs. Returning Visitors`| The proportion of first-time visitors compared to those who have visited before.|
|`Frequency of Visits`| How often users return to the site or app.|
|`Churn Rate`| The rate at which users stop engaging with the site over a period.|
|`Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) Contribution`| While not purely clickstream, clickstream data helps inform user behavior that contributes to CLTV.|
|`Re-engagement Rate`| The percentage of inactive users who return to the site after a period of inactivity.|


## 4. Performance & Usability KPIs:

> These metrics evaluate the technical efficiency and ease of use of a website or application, encompassing aspects like page load times and instances of error clicks, to identify friction points.

|Command | description|
|---------------------|-------------|
|`Load Time (per page/element)`| While not a direct click, it impacts the clickstream flow if users abandon due to slow loading.|
|`Error Clicks`| Instances where users click on non-clickable elements, indicating UI confusion.|
|`Searches within Site`| What users are looking for using the internal search bar.|
|`Client-Side Errors (JavaScript errors)`| Technical errors that occur during user interaction, indicating potential bugs or broken functionality.|
|`Page Rendering Speed (FCP, LCP)`| More advanced metrics beyond simple load time that measure the perceived speed of content loading, directly impacting user experience and indirectly click flow.|
|`Browser/Device Performance Metrics`| How different browsers or devices impact load times and interaction smoothness.|


## 5. Conversion Funnel KPIs

> These key performance indicators track user progression through multi-step processes, such as checkout or sign-up forms, highlighting drop-off rates at each stage to optimize conversion goals.

|Command | description|
|---------------------|-------------|
|`Funnel Drop-off Rates`| At what stage users abandon a multi-step process (e.g., checkout, sign-up forms).|
|`Time to Convert`| The average time it takes for a user to complete a conversion goal from their first visit|
|`Assisted Conversions`| When a conversion path includes interactions across multiple channels or pages before the final conversion.|
|`Time Lag to Conversion`| The time elapsed between a user's first visit and their eventual conversion.|
|`Path Length to Conversion`| The number of pages or steps a user takes to complete a conversion.|


## Usecases of Clickstream data in Ecommerce : 

> Clickstream data is incredibly valuable for e-commerce companies, as it provides a detailed understanding of customer behavior and interactions on their website or app.

## 1. Optimizing User Experience (UX) and Website Design

|Usecase | description|
|---------------------|-------------|
|`Identifying Navigation Issues`| By analyzing click paths and exit rates, e-commerce companies can pinpoint pages where users frequently abandon their journey or get lost, indicating confusing navigation or poor design elements.|
|`Improving Site Layout`| Heatmaps derived from click data can show which areas of a page users interact with most (or least), guiding the placement of important content and calls-to-action.|
|`Personalizing Content Display`| Understanding which popular content areas receive the most views allows companies to prioritize and personalize what users see first.|

## 2. Personalization and Recommendations

|Usecase | description|
|---------------------|-------------|
