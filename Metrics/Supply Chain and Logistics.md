# 🚚 Supply Chain and Logistics Metrics

> Supply chain and logistics metrics are crucial for evaluating the efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and responsiveness of the entire flow of goods, from raw materials to the final customer. They help identify bottlenecks, optimize processes, and ultimately improve customer satisfaction and profitability.


## 📦 A. Customer Service & Delivery Metrics

> These metrics gauge how well the supply chain meets customer expectations.



### 1. 📦 On-Time Delivery (OTD) Rate

---

> **Definition:** The percentage of orders delivered to the customer on or before the promised delivery date.
>
> This metric is crucial for evaluating supply chain efficiency and customer satisfaction.

---

> **Formula:**
>
> ```
> OTD Rate = (Total Number of Deliveries / Number of On-Time Deliveries) × 100%
> ```
>
> _**Note on the formula:** While the provided formula is `(Total Number of Deliveries / Number of On-Time Deliveries) × 100%`, the standard and logically correct formula for On-Time Delivery Rate (based on the definition) is typically: `(Number of On-Time Deliveries / Total Number of Deliveries) × 100%`. Please ensure you are using the formula that aligns with your specific definition and calculation methodology._
